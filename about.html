<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I was born in 1991 in Taranto, in the south of Italy. </p>
<p>During my MSc in Molecular Biology, I focused my attention on Bioinformatics, particularly on mitochondrial genomics data. My thesis involved working on a biological database, <a href="https://www.hmtdb.uniba.it" title="HmtDB" target="_blank">HmtDB</a>, and its web interface, so I started diving into programming, data management and web development. </p>
<p>After graduating, I attended an internship at <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org" title="ELIXIR" target="_blank">ELIXIR</a> in Cambridge, UK, where I developed the <a href="http://bioschemas.org" title="Bioschemas" target="_blank">Bioschemas</a> website, as well as a data validator for <a href="http://schema.org" title="Schema.org" target="_blank">Schema.org</a> metadata. This allowed me to deepen my knowledge of web development and design. </p>
<p>At the moment I'm a PhD student in Genomics and Proteomics, working on mitochondrial big data, so my daily tasks involve dealing with massive amounts of data, extracting useful information from biological sequences, and exporting these enhanced data through the web.<br>
I also co-founded a university spin-off company named <a href="https://browser-bioinf.com" title="BROWSer" target="_blank">BROWSer</a>, which offers bioinformatics solutions and research counselling.</p>
