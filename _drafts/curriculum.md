### Personal skills

* * *

#### Communication skills

Good communication and integration skills, mainly developed during my tutoring activities in University, since constant student-tutor as well as tutor-administrators interactions were needed; I further improved these skills during my work at ELIXIR, in which I had to periodically present the goals I had achieved and the tasks I was going to tackle for an ongoing project.

* * *

#### Organizational and managerial skills

Great skills in job organization and distribution of tasks, gained during my work at ELIXIR and University internships, in which it was required to work on a specific project analyzing one particular side of it, though cooperating and sharing findings with the whole working group.

* * *

#### Job-related skills

Great knowledge of bioinformatics tools to analyse and characterise biological sequences; great propensity to create new tools and problem-based computational resources.

Great knowledge of web development and various web programming frameworks and Content Management Systems.

Great knowledge of Python frameworks for data analysis, visualization and machine learning. 

Good knowledge of nucleic acids extraction, purification and sequencing protocols from biologic samples.

* * *

#### Computer skills

- Great knowledge of the main packages for bioinformatics data analysis, both web-based and stand-alone

- Great knowledge of Python and Shell programming languages

- Great knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Wordpress and Drupal CMS and of web development in general

- Great knowledge of the MS Office suite, OSs (especially UNIX-based ones) and web navigation

I have, and always had, a great passion for IT in general, besides bioinformatics, and I'm very interested in learning new programming languages and data analysis protocols.
