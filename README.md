# robertopreste.com  

Code for my personal website [robertopreste.com](https://robertopreste.com).  

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).  

The design and layout is based upon a mesh of the Astral and Dimension themes from [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/), which I further customised, including a cool background from [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/).
