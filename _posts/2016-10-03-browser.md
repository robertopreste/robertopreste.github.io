[BROWSer](http://browser-bioinf.com) is a spin-off company of the University of Bari, and provides healthcare users with genomics experience and services.  

BROWSer (Bioinformatics Resource for Omics-Wide Services) offers bioinformatics data analysis pipelines, sequencing services and counselling for genomics research. I am a co-founder of this company and I work as a bioinformatician, developing software to analyse biological data.  

I developed this website using WordPress.
