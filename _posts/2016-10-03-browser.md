[BROWSer](http://browser-bioinf.com) is a spin-off company of the University of Bari, and provides healthcare users with genomics experience and services.  

BROWSer (Bioinformatics Resource for Omics-Wide Services) offers bioinformatics data analysis pipelines, sequencing services and counselling for genomics research. I am one of the co-founders of this company.
