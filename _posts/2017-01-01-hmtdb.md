[HmtDB](http://www.hmtdb.uniba.it) is a biological database containing human mitochondrial genomes and associated metadata.  

The Human Mitochondrial Database (HmtDB) contains over 30000 human mitochondrial genome sequences annotated with population and variability data, supporting human genetics and clinical research.  

I developed this website using Python Flask and Sqlite.
