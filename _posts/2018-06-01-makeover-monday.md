[#MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk) is a weekly social data project proposing to rework a chart every Monday in order to show its data more effectively or find a new story in the data.  

For this project, [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) is the tool of choice, given its great capabilities at creating visualization dashboards that allow to focus on different details of the underlying data.  

All my dashboards are available on my [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/roberto.preste#!/) profile, but I will post my work here as well, in the [Data Science](/datascience) section using the [#MakeoverMonday](/tags/#makeovermonday) tag.
