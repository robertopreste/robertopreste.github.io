Bioschemas is a collaborative effort that aims to improve data interoperability in life sciences.

The Bioschemas projects was created to encourage people in life science to use schema.org markup, so that their websites and services contain consistently structured and discoverable information.  

I developed this website using Jekyll, during an internship at ELIXIR in Cambridge, UK.
