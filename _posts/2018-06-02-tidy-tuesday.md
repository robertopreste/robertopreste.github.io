[#TidyTuesday](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/) is a weekly social data project focused on using the tidyverse collection of R packages to clean, wrangle, tidy and plot a new dataset every Tuesday.  

I recently discovered this and decided to start this "challenge" in order to deepen my knowledge of the R programming language, particularly its applications in Data Science.  

All my posts are available in my dedicated GitHub repository [MyTidyTuesday](https://github.com/robertopreste/MyTidyTuesday), but I will post my work here as well, in the [Data Science](/datascience) section using the [#TidyTuesday](/tags/#tidytuesday) tag.
