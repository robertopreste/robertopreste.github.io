[HmtVar](https://www.hmtvar.uniba.it) is a biological database that provides information about human mitochondrial DNA variants.  

HmtVar contains human mitochondrial variants' data, which are integrated with pathogenicity predictions and variability information, together with further annotations coming from several external online resources.  

I developed this website using Python Flask and Sqlite.
