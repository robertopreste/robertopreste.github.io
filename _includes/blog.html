        Occasionally, I like writing about programming, data science and bioinformatics. I mostly write a post for my own later reference, but probably you might find something useful too.

        All my post are available through my <a href="https://medium.com/@robertopreste" title="Medium" target="_blank">Medium</a> page. Should you find one of my articles helpful, please feel free to <i>clap</i> it and share it on social media.

    <h3>Why an external blog?</h3>
    <p>
        I used to host my own blog here on robertopreste.com, but with the last restyling of this website I decided to move everything to Medium. I prefer using a platform specifically suited for blogging, rather that reinvent the wheel and build my own; same applies for my projects, most of which are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/robertopreste" title="GitHub" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. By the way, you might want to have a look at my
        <a href="#work" title="Work">work</a> too.
    </p>

        This reflects my general preference towards small, modular and focused applications, compared to a huge single platform that should take care of too many things at a time.
